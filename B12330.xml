      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>To mak this mater plainer to the Reader, quhairupon our hale diſputation ſtandis. I thoght beſt, or I reaſonit aganis his concluſion: quhilk of it ſelf is ſumpart intricat, and difficil, throw ſum wordis of it, that may haue dowble vnderſtanding: quhilk he appearis to haue ſaid plainely and ſimply, bot with ane dowble face (quhilk euery man perceauis nocht) that he may induce men the readiar to his purpoſe, ſaying. The Kirk of God is the onely appointit Iudge be God, to decerne and interprete the rycht vnderſtanding of the Scripture, fra the wrang: for thir worhis (the rycht vnderſtanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the wrang) may moue ſum men to think that the Scripture hes ane wrang vnderſtanding of it awm nature, quhairby they may be mouit the eaſyar, to beleue that God had appointit the Kirk, or ſum vther Iudge, to decerne the ryght vnderſtanding of it, fra the wrang: and that the Scripture could nocht be ane Iudge to decerne the ſamyn, for than it had bene ane Iudge to it ſelf, in it awin cauſe. Or be thir wordis (the rycht vnderſtanding of the Scripture, and the wrang) he vnderſtandis the rycht vnderſtanding of the Scripture, and the wrang, that men takkis of the Scripture, throw thair awin ignorance, other of the ordinarie meanes (quhairby God geuis the vnderſtanding of his Scriptures) or of the difficill mater, contenit vnder the wordes of the Scripture, or of the interpretation of the Scriptures, out of ane language in ane other, or ony vther wayes.</p>
                  <p>And giue he vnderſtandis in his concluſion, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God hes ane rycht vnderſtanding and ane wrang, be it awin nature, I ſay, that his concluſion (quhilk he haldis to be als ſure as it war ane decrete of the haly Spirite) includis in the ſelf; ane manifeſt falſet, quhilk is, that the Scripture of God hes ane wrang vnderſtanding, quhilk it hes nocht, for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:177915:7"/> the Scripture giues nocht ane wrang vnderſtanding, nor ane wrang interpretation of it ſelf: bot men that is at controuerſie for maters of Religione, throw ignorance, or ſum vther pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to eſtabliſche thair action, ſum of thaim interpretis, and vnderſtandis the Scripture wrang, and alledgis thair inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and vnderſtanding to be rycht (be fit ordinarie mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis as God hes geuin to men to proue, or ſeik the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scripture to be rycht) that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue of it. As ar the ſciences callit liberal artes, the knawledge of the thre prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall languages, conference of Scriptures with Scripturs, the preceptis of the maiſt Ancient Doctors, and ſiclyke thingis that ſeruis men, to bring thaim to the knawledge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: quhilk notwithſtanding, men oft tymes vſes nocht rychtly, throw thair awin ignorance. Swa thay tak ane wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vnderſtanding of the Scriptur, quhilk it geuis nocht to thaim, becauſe thair is na thing wrang in it. As we may vnderſtand be Peter, in the end of his Second Epiſtle, ſaying. In the Epiſtles of Paule, thair is ſum thingis hard to be vnderſtand, quhilk thay that ar vnlearnit, and vnſtable peruertis, as thay do alſo vther Scriptures, vnto thair awin diſtruction. ȝe thairfore belouit (ſayis he) ſeing ȝe knaw thir thingis before, be warre, inauentures ȝe be alſo plukit away with the error of the wickit, and fall fra all ȝour ſtedfaſtnes. Marke weill godly Reader, Peter ſayis, the Scriptures is hard to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and thairfore he exhortis the faithfull, that thay be nocht led away with the error of the wickit, quhilk cumis nocht of the Scripture, bot throw Ignorance of the vnlearnit, that peruertis the Scripture: or of the vnſtable, men throw thair lycht Imaginations. For giue God had maid his Scripture of that nature, that it mycht haue had twa faces, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingis, as the anſwers of the Gentile Gods had, men mycht haue bene diſſauit be the Scriptures of God, as men was be the anſwers of the Gentile Gods, quhilk war vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly to be ſaid. And alſwa thay men that had fallin in error, wald haue had ane iuſte excuſation, that the wrang vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the Scripture gaue thaim, was the cauſe of thair fal. Quhairby, now na man iuſtly can excuſe him ſelf, for it hes nocht ane wrang vnderſtanding, bot ſum men takis ane wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vnderſtanding of it, quhilk takis away thair excuſation, and layis thair error vpon thair awin ignorance, and vnſtablenes. Quhairfore (ſen the Scripture of God hes nocht ane wrang vnderſtanding of it ſelf) it is manifeſt that God hes not appoin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tit his Kirk to be Iudge, to decerne the rycht vnderſtanding of
<pb facs="tcp:177915:8"/> the Scripture, fea the wrang, that it had of the awin nature, quhilk giue he had done, it war ane great abſurditie, for that war als mekle to ſay, as God had appointit the Kirk to be Iudge, betuix the thing that is, and is not.</p>
                  <p>And giue he vnderſtandis his concluſione on this maner, that the Kirk of God is the onely appointit Iudge be God, to decerne and interprete the rycht vnderſtanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, fea the wrang, that men takis thairof, throw thair awin Ignorance, or ony vther wayis, to ſtabliſhe thair part of the controuerſie and debait, for maters of Religion, that is ryſin betuix thaim, and ony vther, as he appearis to vnderſtand it, be all his reaſons and groundis, quhairby he intendis to proue his concluſion.

Siclyke Chriſt Ieſus, at his departing to his Apoſtles, the cheif Paſtors of the vniuerſall Congregatione, he gaue ane generall charge to thaim all, ſaying, pas throw the hale warld, and preache the Euangell to all Creature. Marck. 16. alſwa in the Firſte Chap. of the Actes of the Apoſtles, makand na mentione of ſic Iudgement, he ſayis vnto thaim, ȝe ſall receaue the power of the haly Gaiſt, quhen he ſall cum on ȝow, and ȝe ſall beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnto me, baith in Ieruſalem, and in all Iudea, and in Samaria, and vnto the vttermoſt part of the earth.

Bot the maiſt thing, that thay ar requirit with, to do aganis thaim that takis of the Scripture ane wrang vnderſtanding, is, to exhort with halſum doctrine, and improue thaim that ſayis aganis it.

                  <p>For than neuer man wald haue credite the plaine Text of the Scripture, mait nor the obſcure, quhil thay had hard the iudge, that God had appointit.

Bot thay that hes had ony controuerſie in tymes bygaine, for the decerning of the rycht vnderſtanding of
<pb facs="tcp:177915:9"/> the Scripture, fra the wrang, and for the opinions that men hes tane of the Scripture, hes chuſit thair iudge as thay pleſit. And becauſe that Chriſte Ieſus hes left na thing to his Kirk bot his Scriptures, to beare witnes of all thingis that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirit for our Saluatione to be knawin of him. Ihon. 5. and his Spirite to teache vs all veritie be men (as his mouth) outwartly, and inwartly be him ſelf, workand in our hartis: quhilk ar the onely thingis quhairby we haue knawledge of the veritie, and diſcretione, betuix the veritie and the falſet, in maters concerning Religione: ſum men thairfore hes referrit the Iudgement of thair controuerſie, to the worde and Spirit of God, as thair iudges, Arbitraris. For this is the onely thingis, that thay quha hes bene at controuerſie for maters of Religione, hes ſocht to haue thair action iudgit be: as we may ſee to haue bene done be Chriſte Ieſus, and mony weil learnit and godly men. For Chriſte Ieſus affirming him ſelf to be the Sonne of God, and the Iowes affirming the contrarie, as is writtin in the .5. Chap. of Ihon, in ſa far as thay wald haue ſlaine him, he appeillis thaim to the Scriptures, to be iudgit thairby, ſaying, ſearch the Scriptures, for in thaim ȝe think to haue the Eternall lyfe: and thay ar thay quhilk teſtifeis of me. Thair culde nocht be ane greater controuerſie, or queſtion, for ony mater of Religione, nor this was, betuix Chriſte Ieſus and the Iowes (quha than in earth was the onely Kirk of God) giue he was the Sonne of God, equale to the Father, or nocht? and he hes referrit him ſelf, as to his awin godly maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, manhead, and doctrine, to be Iudgit be the Scriptures in this controuerſie and nocht vnto thaim quha had the power in the kirk, and the Iowes ſayis na thing aganis the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in this place, quhy thay may not be iudge betuix thaim, And ȝit the Scriptures was nocht the appointit Iudge be God, betuix Chriſte Ieſus and the Iowes.</p>
                  <p>¶ And giue ony man will obiect, that quhatſumeuer thing bearis witnes, it can nocht be ane Iudge in the ſame ſelf cauſe, bot the Scripture bearis witnes of Chriſte, betuix him and the Iowes, giue he be the Sonne of God, or nocht: thairfore thay can nocht be Iudge, becauſe thay beare witnes of him. I anſwer, that in warldly and mortall thingis, for vſing of parcialitie, ane thing can nocht gudlie be baith Iudge and witnes: bot in thay thingis that is euerlaſting and immortal, quhilk can nocht vſe parcialitie (as is the word of God) ane thing may baith beare witnes and be Iudge. Thairfore it is na inconuenient, that the Scriptures baith beare witnes and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:177915:9"/> be Iudge in ony controuerſie for maters of Religion, for and thair war twa that diſaggreit vpon ane Artickle of our beleue (as for exemple) giue ane denyit that Chriſte Ieſus was borne of ane Virgine, and ane vther affirmit that he was borne of ane Virgine, and thir twa wald referre thaim baith to the iudgement of the Scripture. And than thir ſayingis of Eſay the Prophet, that is ſpokin of Chriſte, war brocht to decyde the controuerſie. Behald ane Virgine ſall conceaue and beare ane Sonne. This Scripture of Eſay is witnes to him, that his aſſertione was trew, quha ſaid Chriſte was borne of ane Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and alſwa it iudges betuix thaim, that the aſſertione of the ane, is trew, and the vther is fals. As ane euin reule, is ane witnes to the thing that is euin, that it is euin. And it is a witnes to the thing that is cruikit, that it is cruikit. And alſwa betuix the euin and the cruikit, it is a iudge, quhilk de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernis the ane to be cruikit, and the vther to be euin.

For nother councell nor Kirk, quhow vniuerſall or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulare that euir it was, can ſay (as he interpretis the kirk or councell) that the greataſt hereſie that euir was, was hereſie: nor ȝit can it ſay, that the rytht vnderſtanding of ony hard &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficile place of the Scripture, ſetfurth be the greataſt Doctor that euir was, is the rycht vnderſtanding thareof: nor the wrang vnderſtanding of the ſame Scripture, ſetfurth be the greataſt heretyke that euir was, is the wrang vnderſtanding thareof, without the haly Spirit, and the worde of God.

                  <p>Tharefore, quhen the Kirk of God, or ony priuate membre thareof, hes ane doutſum queſtione, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie in ony mater of religione, as is all hereſeis, it aperteanis to thaim be ſic ordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>narie meanis, and gracis, as the haly Spirit hes i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dewit thaim with, to ſee, quhilk of the partis of thare doutſum queſtione, aggreis with the Scripture of God, and quhilk nocht, as the Apoſtles did. Acto. 15. And that the vnderſtanding, quhilk is found of the difficile ſcripture, that is ſocht for ony co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie, conſent, and aggre with all vther places of the Scripture, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding and following, and diſaggre with nanc: quhilk is to be ſocht, as Auguſtine teachis vs ſaying, be the things following of the ſame text, and that quhilk is adioynit thareto, the dout, or the repugnance, is to be tane away. Libro. 3. de Doctrina Chriſtiana Cap. 2. et contra Fauſtum Manicheum, Libro. 9. Cap. 67. He ſayis nocht that the dout is to be tane away be the general councel, or be the Doctours, bot be the thingis fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of the ſame text, and that, quhilk is adioynit thareto. Quhilk being tane away (nocht be the Kirk, or ony membre thairof, bot be the worde of God) it apertenis to the Kirk, and euery membre thareof, to conſent with that part of ony dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum queſtione, in maters of Religione, that the Scripture of God aggreis with: &amp; diſaſſent fra that part, that the Scripture diſaggreis with, as the Apoſtles did, in the councel of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And efter that the hereſie be ſuppreſt, be the Spirit, and word of God: it pertenis to the hale kirk, to adioyne that authoritie,
<pb facs="tcp:177915:21"/> quhilk God hes geuin to it, to the part aggreing with the Scriptures. As for exemple, and this dout, or queſtione war mouit in the kirk of God. Is it leſum to ony man, to make to him ſelf ony grauin Image, to bow doune thareto, in the Temples? Than quhat can the kirk, or Councell ſay thareto? na thing: quhill thay luik quhat the Scripture of God, the teſtimoneis of the haly Spirit, hes Iudgit and determinat. And becauſe the kirk, or Councell, in the Scripture findis, that Images is forbiddin, and condamnit be God, all the godly members of the kirk, and Councel conſentis to the haly ſpirit, and Scriptures ſpokin be the members of the kirk (as his mouth) and be the authoritie that God hes geuin to the kirk, it commandis, that thay that makis Images to thaim ſelf, to bow doune to thaim, &amp; worſchip thaim, be haldin as Ethnikis, and Publicanis: or efter ane admonitione, or twa, that all men flee fra thaim, and as Idolaters, that na man tak meat with thaim. Siclyke, thare is ane great controuerſie, betuix the Proteſtantes, and the Papiſtes, vpon the vnderſtanding of thir wordis, that Chriſte Ieſus ſaid in his Supper. This is my body, ilk ane thinking thaim ſelf to haue the rycht vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding heirof. Than quhat ſall the kirk of God do in this mater? Sall it ſtand onely to the determinatione of the Councels, without farder tryall taking in the mater? Or to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione of the beſt learnit men? nother. Bot the kirk, and the beſt learnit men, that euer was, ſould luik firſt be the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie meanis, and Scriptures, quhilk is the vnderſtanding heirof. And becauſe the Sacramentall ſpeachis of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſeruis beſt to oppin this place of the Scripture, for the quhilk the controuerſie is. Tharefore the Proteſtantes, ſeing the Scripture of God, in the Sacramentall ſpeachis, to gif the Name of the thing, that is ſignifeit be the Sacramentall ſigne, to the ſigne: as in the .12. Chap. of Exod. Quhare it is writtin: This is the Paſouer of the Lorde: and quhare ſall we prepare to thee, the Paſouer? Math. 26. This is my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, Gene. 17. Quhilk is als mekle to ſay, as this is the ſigne of the Paſouer. This is the ſigne of my Couenant. Swa the Proteſtantes ſeing, that this is the vnderſtanding of this Sacramentall ſpeachis, to the quhilk, this Sacramentall ſpeach (this is my body) is alyke. The Proteſtantes is aſſurit be the worde of God, to haue the rycht vnderſtanding of this place, this is my body. For as the kirk of God, and the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers thareof, conſentit in all aiges, this to be the vnderſtanding of this Sacramentall ſpeach, this is the Paſouer of the Lorde,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:177915:21"/> this is the ſigne of the Paſouer. Siclyke it ſould conſent, that of this Sacramentall ſpeach (this is my body) this is the richt vnderſtanding thareof, this is the ſigne of my body. Not that I meane, thare to be onely ane baire ſigne, bot ane Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſigne, with the quhilk. God exhebitis to the receauer wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely, that thing quhilk is ſignifeit be the ſame ſigne. And not onely ſould the Kirk conſent thareto, bot alſwa, be the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie it hes of God, it ſould command it awin members, to hald all thaim, quha beleuit the bread and the wyne, to be tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciat, in the body and blude of Chriſte: or Chriſte Ieſus body to be incloſit within the formes of bread and wyne, as Ethnikis, and publicanis (as all Papiſtes ſould be haldin amangis trew Chriſtianis) and to flee fra thare company, as Heretykes, and Idolaters, quha be the determinatione of thare Councels, without Scripture of God, hes commandit, as Lordes ouer Chriſtiane mennis Faith, that all men beleue the bread and wyne to be tranſubſtantiat in the body &amp; blude of Chriſt Ieſus, als lang and braid, as he was borne of the Virgine Marie, and crucifeit on the Croce, vnder the formes of bread and wyne, quhilk altogether is wickit. For thare is na Councel, that can moue ony man to beleue ony thing concerning Religione, be ony authoritie, that euer thay may alledge thaim ſelf to haue, without Gods worde. For Auguſtine ſayis, that it is neceſſare to be prouin, be the manifeſt teſtimoneis of the haly Scripturs, that we wald war beleuit. Contra Epiſt. Petili. Donatiſt. de vnitate Eccle. Cap. 19. Siclyke he ſayis, he wald nocht haue beleuit the Eua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Marke weill his worde, commouit, and nocht mouit: for be this worde commouit, he meanis, that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Kirk, or decretis thareof, is nocht ſufficient be thair ſelf, to moue ony man to beleue the Euangell, bot with the Spirite and worde of God, to commoue the myndes of Gods choſin people to beleue. Quharefore, ſen nother the ſcripture of God, nor the Doctoures ſayingis, nor ȝit na gude reaſone, teaches vs to ſeik the ſuppreſſing of Hereſeis, or the rycht vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Scriptures, fra the wrang, bot at the haly Spirite, and the worde of God: I beleue M. Q. nor na godly man will attribute to the generall Councels, that thing quhilk appertenis onely to the haly Spirite, and the worde of God: as is the ſuppreſſing of Hereſeis, and the diſcretione of the rycht vnderſtanding of the Scriptures, fra the wrang, vtherwayis the warld wald liue in perpetuall debait, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentione,

                  <p>And giue ony man wald obiect, that the Kirk of God hes re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceauit ſum Scripturs, as Canonicall, and hes refuſit vthers, as Apocripha: Quharefore it appearis to be ſure, that the kirk hes power onely to decerne, and Iudge the Scripturs: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing power to Iudge the Scripturs, farre mair ſulde it haue power (as appearis) to Iudge, quhilk is the rycht vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I anſwer, that the Kirk receauit the Scripturs, na v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wayis, than thay war offerit, and delyuerit be thaim, that wrat thaim to the Kirk: quha was knawin ſurely be the reſt of the Kirk, to be full of the haly Spirit: bot thay war nocht of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferit, nor delyuerit to the Kirk to be Iudgit, or to be receauit be the Kirkis Iudgement. Bot of thay Scripturs that was delyuerit, as Canonical be the Apoſtles, and the Euangeliſtis: the Kirk fra tyme to tyme, hes borne faithfull wytnes thareof to the Poſteritie, that thay war Canonicall, of the quhlk the Kirk could neuer take on it to Iudge. For the Apoſtles &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſtis of thare awin wyll cheſit not, to bryng in the Kirk ony thing, bot that, quhilk thay receauit fra Chriſte, faithfully thay ſchew it to the Nations, as ſayis Tertuliane. For as the Scripturs of the auld Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, was not Iudgit be the preiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, nor Miniſters, nor be the Synagog to be Canonicall, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrypha: bot was kepit (as ſayis Auguſtine) in the Temple of the Hebrew people, be the deligence of the ſucceding preiſtis Deut. 31. Ioſue vltimo. Hebr. 9. Swa the Kirk, nother recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit, nor refuſit, nor ȝit Iudgit it ony Scripture, be it awin auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, bot thay buikis, quhilk it receauit fra the Apoſtles, and Euangeliſtis: ſen the Apoſtles, and Euangeliſtis dayis, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruptione of tyme, hes brocht thaim on to this tyme. Contra Fauſtum Manicheum, Lib. 28. Cap. 2. e. And in the ſame buke he ſayis. Cap. 4. quhen the Apoſtle Paule, efter the Aſcenſione of the Lorde, was callit of the Heauin: giue he had nocht found the Apoſtles lyuing, with quhom he mycht haue appearit, to haue bene of the ſame fallowſchipe be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, and conferrning of the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gell with thaim, (Galat. 2.) the Kirk on na wayis had beleuit him. Be this ſayngs of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, it may be clearlie ſene, that the Kirk of God, nother ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mittit, nor refuſit the Scripturs, he it awin autoritie. Bot
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:177915:22"/> becauſe the kirk of the Apoſtles dayis, had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municatione and conferring of the Scripturs with the Apoſtles, and Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtis: and thay Scripturs that the primitiue kirk receauit of thare handis, the kirk ſucceding, as ane faithfull wytnes, hes brocht thay ſcripturs to be beleuit on to our dayis. And thare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nother kirk, nor councels had power to Iudge the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, nor to decerne the rycht vnderſtanding of the Scripturs fra the wrang, be thare Iudgement &amp; pleaſour. For Auguſtine ſayis Lib. 13. confeſſion. Cap. 23. it is nocht leſum of ſa hie autoritie to Iudge, nor ȝit of thy buike: ȝea, ſuppoſe thare be ſum thing thare nocht manifeſt, becauſe we ſubmitt to it oure vnderſtanding, and we halde it ſure, ȝea, and it that is hid to our ſycht, rychteouſlie &amp; trewly to be ſaid. Ane man quhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he be now ſpiritual, and renewit in the knawlege of God, according to his Image, quha hes creatit him, nochtheles, he ſulde be ane doar of the law, and nocht ane Iudge. Tharefore the Apoſtles being in the primitiue kirk, quha be the inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one of the haly Spirit, wrat the Scripturs: &amp; delyuerit thaim to the kirk (manifeſtlie contening all thingis, that conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Bot efter that this was done, it was nocht leſum to the kirk ſucceding, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete thay Scripturs at thare pleaſoure: bot the Spirite of Chriſt, firſt was to be hard: and the mutuall conſent of all the places of the Scripture, was diligentlie to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidderit, of the quhilk, we haue this familiare exemple. As quhen the kingis letters cummis to ony Citie, the Rewlars and gouernours of the Citie, of ane cuſtome may take tryall, giue thay letters be ſeuzeit or nocht, that is preſent it to thaim in the kyngis name. Bot quhen thay vnderſtand, thay letters not to be ſeuzeit, nor corruptit, it is nocht leſum, at thare pleaſour, to alter, or change thaim, nor to mak expoſitione, or gloſe on thaim, bot obey the kyngis co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand, as it is ſetfurth tharein. And na vther wayis can we iudge of the Kirk: for quhowbeit it is ane faithful keipar of the Scripturs, ȝit it is nocht leſum to it, to conſtitute ony v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing of thaim, vtherwayis than God hes determinat.</p>
                  <p>Quharefore, ſen the councels (as he interpretis thaim, the cheif Paſtours of the Vniuerſall Congregatione) is men for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounlie blynde, affectionat, &amp; dull of ſpirit, and takis on thaim to decerne, and determine thay thingis that is proponit in thare councels, quhilk appertenis onely to the Halye Spirit, &amp; word of God: I ſay na man is obleſt to ſubſcriue, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to the ſentence of thay Councels, mair nor to the ſentence of ane

Bot becauſe, thay aggre with the worde of God (quharein is contenit the mynde and will of the haly Spirit) approuing it to be trew, be the quhilk it takis the ſtrenth, efficacie, and denominatione. For gif Peter (quha appearit to be ane Pillare of the kirk (Gal. 2) and was ſa great Apoſtle) had errit, and Paule had nocht re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtit vnto him, quhat ſall we ſay than of the Congregatione of men, that is led vp and doune with affectionis, blyndnes, and errour, as hes bene mony of the Councels, ſen the Apoſtles dayis, in the quhilk, thare hes nocht bene ſa mekle, as ane ſchaddow of the haly Spirit. Tharefore, lat all thingis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religione, be brocht to the Scripturs of God, the teſtimoneis of the haly Spirit, the twiche ſtaine, and equale Iudge, that be thay things that is certane, and ſtable, ordoure mat be tane in doutſum maters. And not to lat doutſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maters be Iudgit be vncertane, and mutable things. For as the ſpirit, and worde of God is ſolide, and immortall, and full of veritie, ſwa is thare decretis, and ſentences eternall, and immortall: and as men (quhow great nombre that euer thay be) is mortal, mutable, and be nature geuin to lie: Swa thare decretis, and ſentences, is vncertane, changeable, and neuer wanting ſuſpitione of falſet.</p>
                  <p>Bot ȝit I wald not, that ony man thocht me of that mynde, that I wald haue all things drawin to the tryall of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs: as that I wald haue godly, and weill learnit men, not hard in godly councels, quha hes the ordinarie meanis, quhars by the ſpirit of God geuis the vnderſtanding of his Scripturs: or that I laboure to euacuat the authoritie of the Kirk, or Councels, and to haue the godly Fathers, and members thare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of neglectit.

                  <p>Paule writing to the Galathianis. 2. Cap. ſayis. Efter fourtene ȝeir, I went vp to Ieruſalem with Barnabas, and tuik with me Titus alſo. And I went vp be Reuelatione, and conferrit with thaim the Euangeli, quhilk I preach amangis the Gentiles. Hierome wryting on this Text, affirmes this Iournay of Paules to Ieruſalem, to haue bene, quhen the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putatione, for the aboliſhing of the Ceremoneis of the auld Law was had, betuix the beleuers of Antiochia and the Iowes And ſwa being as Hierome affirmes, quhais ſaying I beleue M. Q. will nocht put in dout. Than be this foreſaid Text, we may cleirly ſee, that Paule and Barnabas, went not vp to Ieruſalem, as doutſum of the thing, quhilk he had preachit ane lang tyme, to the Antiochianis that beleuit, quhilk was, that it was nocht neceſſare, to thaim to be circumciſit for thare Saluatione. Bot becauſe thare was ſum of the Brethren in Antiochia, that doutit gif that Paulis doctrine was trew or nocht.</p>
                  <p>Thay hearing ſum fals brethren, aduerſours to Paule, quha vnder the culloure and name of the Apoſtles, that was in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, preachit that it was neceſſare that the Gentiles that beleuit in Antiochia, ſould be circumciſit, and that the doctrine of Paule, was contrare to the doctrine of the Apoſtles in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, quhilk mycht haue cauſit men of ane ſincere Faith, to haue doutit, hearing the doctrine of the principall Doctours diſaggre: he aſcendit to Ieruſalem. And I conferrit (ſayis Paule) the Euangel with thaim, that I preach to the Gentiles, quhlk as Hierome notes on this worde, is, quhen thay things that we knaw, we conferre with ane frend. And, as in his boſum, we lay it, that thay things that we knaw, with ane vniforme Councell may be approuit. Tharefore, be Hieromes ſayings we may vnderſtand, that he aſcendit nocht, that the reſt of the Apoſtles ſould haue teachit him: For it is ane vther thing to conferre, and ane vther thing to be teachit, for betuix thaim that conferris, thare is equalitie, and betuix the Teacher, and him that is teachit, thare is inequalitie.</p>
                  <p>Quharefore he aſcendit to rehears, that quhilk he had teachit: to the effect, that thay of Ieruſalem mycht ſubſcrine to the

Nocht that his preaching, quhilk was the veritie of Gods worde, nedit the conſent or witneſſing of men, (for he ſchawis, it already to be confermit be God: in ſa far, as he aſcendit be Reuelatione) bot that he mycht haue ane teſtimoniall of the haly Spirit, and Apoſtles, that was thare, to make it manifeſt to the warld, that it was na vther thing that he teachit in Antiochta, bot that the haly Spirit and the reſt of the Apoſtles, had approuit be thare teſtimoniall, be the quhilk, gif that Paules aduerſours had obiectit efterwart, circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one to haue bene neceſſare to the Gentiles that beleuit, be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone thay mycht haue ſaid againe, that the Apoſtles had ſwa teachit in Ieruſalem, that this teſtimoniall of the Kirk of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, quhilk was in ſindrie places deuulgate, mycht haue conuictit thaim of falſet. And be the ſame teſtimoniall, that thay quha beleuit, ſould haue na dout of thare Saluatione, ſuppoſe thay had not bene circumciſit, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiddering in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Epiſtle is contenit, the decrete of the haly Spirit, in the quhilk is decretit, that the ȝok of the Law, be nocht put vpon thaim that beleuit in Chriſte. And tharefore it was ſend to Antiochia, be the hand of Iudas, callit Barſabas, and Silas, to ſtanch the diſputatione, betuix the Iowes and the Gentiles: Quhidder gif circumciſione to the Gentiles that beleuit, was neceſſare or nocht? Quharefore be the Scripture, and als be Hieromes ſayingis, for the cauſes foreſaid, I may iuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude aganis M. Q.

Raſe vp Peter, and efter conferring of Scripturs, declarit Baptiſme ſufficient without circumciſione. And als Iames cytit the Scripturs, to beare witneſſing, and approuit the ſayingis of Peter, quhilk being done. Iames in the Name of the reſt of the Apoſtles (becauſe he was Paſtor and Biſhop of Ieruſalem, quhare the Apoſtles conuenit for the tyme) pronouncit ſentence, and ſaid, I Iudge.

                  <p>QVhare. M. Q. heir ſayis, that Iames in the Name of the reſt of the Apoſtles (becauſe he was Biſchop of Ieruſalem, quhare the apoſtles was conuenit for the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:177915:29"/> tyme) pronouncit ſentence. I ſay his ſayingis hes na ground, and that I tak to proue be diuers reaſonis. Firſte we may ſee in the diſputatione, that Peters reaſone is, quhy the Gentiles that beleuit ſould nocht be circumciſit: for God (ſayis he) wald haue thaim hearing the worde of the Euangell, be my mouth, and beleue. And he hes put na difference, betuix vs that is Iowes, and thaim that is Gentiles, in geuing thaim the haly Spirit, and be faith hes purifeit thare hartis. Tharefore now, quhy tempt ȝe God, to lay ane ȝok on the Diſciples neckis. And thir laſt wordis is rehearſit againe, in the Decrete of the haly Spirit, put in writ be the Councell, placing this worde burdene, for ȝok, quhilk ſignifeis heir baith ane thing. Iames heirefter, to approue Peters reaſone, he alledges Amoz the Prophet, and vp one him he groundis his reaſone, quhy the Gentiles that beleuit ſould nocht be circumciſit, making his exhortatione to the Congregatione on this maner: ſaying.</p>
                  <p>Quharefore I think beſt, that we trouble thaim nocht of the Gentiles, that ar turnit to God, bot that we write to thaim, that thay abſtene thaim ſelues fra filthynes of Idoles, and Fornicatione, and that is wirreit, and fra blude: and of Iames wordis thare is ſum put in the decrete Siclyke.</p>
                  <p>Than I ſay, gif this had bene the ſentence that Iames had geuin in the Name of the hale Apoſtles, as M. Q. alledgis, Iames failȝeit to Peter, that maid na mentione of his wordis, of the quhilk, the hale Councell in the writtin decrete makis mentione. And mairattoure, the Councell had failȝeit to Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that wald nocht write the ſentence of the Councell, as it was pronouncit be him, gif he pronouncit the ſentence in the Name of the hale Apoſtles: for in the writtin decrete of the hale Councell, thare is mekle left out, that Iames ſpak in his exhortatione, quhilk M. Q. callis Iames ſentence: Bot thare was na ſic variance amangs thaim. Quharefore in the decrete of the Councel, nother Pethers nor Iames ſayings is followit, bot the effect of baith thare ſayings (as members of the councel, geuing thare reaſonis as vthers did, in the diſputatione that was thare) was concludit: ſaying, it hes pleaſit the haly gaiſt and vs. &amp;c.

Bot that ȝe abſtene ȝour ſelues fra filthynes of Idoles, and Fornicatione, and that is wirreit and, from blude, as Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes ſayis.</p>

For inſafar he readis, ſecundum me, he ſchawis that Iames was nocht ſa arrogant, and Lordlie ouer his brethren, as that he tuke on him to pronunce ſentence in the name of the reſt, or that he walde haue al vthers addictit to his ſayings in the councell. Bot ſchawing his Iudgement be it ſelf, quhat he thocht beſt to be done, according to the Scripturs in the controuerſie, proponit before thaim: he leauis place to all vthers that ws thare preſent, quhat thay thoct beſt to be done in the mater. Nor it is nocht lyke, that Iames wald ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue bene ſa raſche, as to haue geuin ſentence, quhill his reaſone firſt had bene hard, &amp; appreuit be the councell, or that he walde haue ſaid, I Iudge, bot we Iudge, giue he gaue the ſentence in the name of the reſt, for thay had all, bot ane commiſſione of God.</p>
                  <p>As to the cauſe, quharefore he alledgis Iames ſulde haue tane vpon him to pronunce ſentence, in the name of the reſt of the Apoſtles: becauſe he was Byſchope of Ieruſalem. This cauſe ſoundis verray neir, to the ambitione of the Papiſtrie, quhilk I beleue na godlie man wyl think to haue bene amang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is the Apoſtles. For in lykewayis, Paule mycht haue ſaid, that he was, Apoſtle, and Byſchope conſtitute be God, to the hale Gentiles, of the hale warlde, and to thay Gentiles, quha had the gouernement of Ieruſalem, at that tyme, that he ſulde haue pronuncit ſentence, in maters perteyning to thaim, to quhome he was Apoſtle. And Peter alſwa mycht haue ſaid, that he ſulde haue pronuncit ſentence, becauſe he was cheif A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle (as M. Q. ſtylis him) quhilk was mair than to be byſchope of ane toun, and alſwa Peter was Apoſtle to all the circumciſit, nocht onely in Ieruſalem, bot throuthour the hale warlde: quhilk was ane greater thing to be, than to haue bene Byſchope of ane Citie of Ieruſalem, vpon the quhilk Pe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, and Paule was alſwa conſtitute Apoſtles: became thay war conſtitute be God, Apoſtles, baith of Iow and Gentile.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:177915:30"/> Gal. 2. bot Iames was choſin be the Apoſtles, Byſchope of Ieruſalem: as teſtifeis Hierome in the Prologe of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall wryttars: and that, as Egeſippus wryttis tſayis Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome.

                  <p>Thridlye, this cauſe quharefore M.

                  <p>Ferdlie, giue thir wordis of Iames had bene the ſentence, geuin in the name of the teſt of the councell, quhart he ſayis, I Iudge nocht to trouble the brether, bot wreit to thaim, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtene thaim ſelf. &amp;c. this words (bot wreit to thaim) had bene imperime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to haue bene put in the myddis of ane ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

This maner of interpretatione, the hale warld may ſee, that it is na worth: For in it, thare is manifeſt wrang done to the haly Spirit, in ſa far as M. Q. ſa ſlychely ouerſeis him (quhom it hes pleaſit the Apoſtles, the Elders, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to put principall, and Firſte, as the onely trew Iudge in the decrete) and geuis onely the dignitie of Iudgement, and preſidencie to the Apoſtles, quhilk thay wald neuer haue tanc on thaim ſelues. And mairattour, I meruell quhow he hes dreamit this interpretatione, and vs as Iudges: conſiddering thare is na mentione maid of Iudgement, before thir wordis, nor behinde. Except that Iames ſayis I think beſt, quhilk I haue ſufficiently ſchawin before, that thir wordis meanit of na Iudgement geuing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, vnder this worde (vs) is contenit nocht onely the Apoſtles, bot alſwa the Elders and Brethren, as may be eaſylie perceauit be the letter writtin in the Councell of the haly Spirit, be the Apoſtles. For the Inſcriptione of the letter contenis the Apoſtles, Elders, and Brethren, quhilk he hes pretermittit in his tractiue, that he mycht interprete this terme (vs) as he pleaſit, quhilk he could not haue done, and he had lukit to the Superſcriptione of the letter. Quhareby we may cleirly ſee, that it is the Scripturs, quhilk geuis the rycht vnderſtanding of the difficill places of the Scripture, and the diſcretione betuix the rycht vnderſtanding of thaim, and the wrang, for the quhilk thare is ony controuerſie, for the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptione of this letter of the Councell, geuis to thaim that luikis on this matter, the rycht interpretatione of this worde (vs.) And alſwa diſcretione betuix the rycht vnderſtanding heirof, and the wrang, without the quhilk, na warldly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could interprete it, nor ȝit could thay decerne, quhidder M.

And alſwa that the warld may ſee, quhom this worde (vs) rehearſis, and to quhom it hes reſpect.</p>

                  <p>¶ Mairattoure, in ſa far as the haly Spirit is put Firſte in this decrete, he can nocht ſay, that it was the Apoſtles decrete, or that thay ar namit heirin as Iudges, without he will attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to thaim, that appertenis onely to the haly Spirit: or els to ſay that the decretis of the haly Spirit, is the decretis baith of God and man, quha will haue na companȝone with him, in making of his decretis. And in ſa far as, he attributis be the notatione he makis in the confirmatione of his Thrid Leſſone, and be this ſentence or decrete foreſaid (call it as he pleaſe) the Iudgement onely to the Apoſtles, he dois great iniurie to the haly Spirit, for quhatſumeuer thing he attributis to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteles, he ſould attribute the ſame, and mair to the haly Spirit, becauſe he is put in the writtin letter, before the Apoſtles, to quhom he geuis the hale Iudgement, making na mentione of the haly Spirit.</p>

                  <p>And gif ony man wil obiect, becauſe the haly Spirit hes not ane mouth, as man to pronounce ſentence, to interprete Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, and to haue communicatione with men, as earthly

                  <p>I anſwer that the mouth of the haly Spirit was the Apoſtles, quha ſpak nocht the Scripturs, nor decernit na thing of thaim, be thaim ſelf: bot the haly Spirit ſpake and decernit be thaim. Tharefore Chriſte Ieſus ſaid to thaim, it is nocht ȝe that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kis, bot the Spirit of your Father that ſpeakis in ȝow. Mat 16. Siclyke quhen Stenin held diſputatione aganis the Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and Syrenitis (as it writtin Actor: 6.) Quhilk coulde not be without cytatione, interpretatione of the Scripturs, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretione betuix the rycht vnderſtanding of thaim fra the wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: ȝit of this diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, the ſcripture attributis na thing to Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin, bot to the wyſedome and Spirit that ſpake in him, quha was na vther Spirit, bot the Spirit of God: quha ſpake be his Prophetis, Apoſtles, and Miniſters (as his mouth) before this tyme. And ſiclyke ay ſall ſpeake be his Miniſters in the earth (as his mouth) all Godlie maters, and ſpecialie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Scripturs to the end of the warlde, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</p>
                  <p>Mairattoure, the Scripturs ſchawis planelie, that the Deuils ſpake on to Chriſte ſaying, giue thow caſtis ws oute of this, ſend ws in the heird of ſwyne. Math. 8. Siclyke thay cryit ſaying, thow is the Sonne of God. Mark. 3. Now thay that wyll grant the Deuyll to ſpeak, I way thay wyll nocht denye ſpeache to the haly Spirit. Quharefore ſen the haly Spirit, be the ſcripturs is perfytlie knawin to be ane doctour in earth, and hes communicatione with the warlde, be his Miniſters (as be his mouth), and thay haue na Godlie thing, bot be him:</p>
                  <p>Nocht only may I collectt, that in this councel of the Apoſtles, the haly Spirit is the onely ſpeaking. Iudge, and ſentence ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uar be his worde: and the Apoſtles, Eldars, and brethren, is bot men, be the quhilk (as Inſtruments) God the haly Spirit ſpeakis his worde. And ſiclyke the ſecunde part of his nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, quhilk he makis on the Text, (as he alledgis) is verray ſlycht ſaying, thare is na Teſtimonie of the Scripture put in the ſentence. Tharefore the Scripture na wayis occupyis the place of ane Iudge. I anſwer, the haly ſpirit is firſt put in the wryttin decrete, quha is neuer ſeperat fra his Scripturs, nor Iudgis na vther wayis, nor thay do, nor the Scripturs Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis na vther wayis nor he dois. And tharefore he being in the decrete, quha be the mouth of Iames, and Peter pronuncit the Scripturs conteyning the ſentence (as his mouth) it was nocht neidfull that the Scripturs, his Teſtimoneis, quhilk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Tharefore it was ſufficient, that ane of thaim was exprimit in the Decrete, and had nother of thaim bene exprimit in the Decrete, it had gottin credit, bot as the Decrete of men. Quharefore be the autoritie of the Scripturs, and reaſons foreſaid, I conclude, that the Kirk of God, (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete the Kirk as he pleaſis, and geuing him for diſputations cauſe, that is is repreſentit, other be general or particulare coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cels, quhow dewlie that euer thay haue bene conuenit) is on na wayis appoyntit Iudge be God to decerne, and interprete the rycht vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the Scripture fra the wrang, quhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeuer queſtione or debait ryſis for the vnderſtanding of the ſame, nor ȝit na mortall thing.

                  <hi>I</hi> dout not, bot ȝour lordſchip remembers, ȝe ſend me ane Schort Tractiue, a lytle before the beginning of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>matione of the Religione in the Kirk of this Realme, contening the hale ſubſtance, and effect of ȝour lytle buik, quhilk is, that the Kirk repreſentit be the generall Councels, dewely conuenit, is (as ȝe alledge) the onely Iudge appoyntit be God, to decerne the rycht vnderſtanding of the Scripture, fra the wrang, quhen queſtione is for the vnderſtanding of the ſame, to haue bene preſentit in that troublus tyme to Iames Betoune Archebiſchope of Glaſgo, our gude Lorde and Maiſter, to haue had his Iudgement and mynde of ȝour ſaid buik, before that tyme laitly Prentit: quhilk for that preſent tyme, we approuit baith to be gude and godly, bot ſen ſyne, I finding the Scripturs ſa weill oppinnit, be the ordinarie mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, quhareby God communicatis vnto men, the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Scripturs, that I could nocht be langer of ȝour opinione, without I wald haue mantenit, as ane ſhameles man, that thing quhilk had nother ground of Scripture, gude reaſone, nor approbatione of the Ancient Doctours. Quhare fore, for the brotherly luife I beare to all men in Chriſte, and for the auld Pariſiane kyndnes, that was betuix vs, to bryng ȝour L. and the people of this Countrie, fra the errour and blyndnes that this lytle buik of ȝours, hes haldin ȝow and thaim baith in. Be ſindrie Scripturs and reaſonis I haue trauellit, vſing me heirin, efter the commone maner of Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, without diſpyte, or reproche, and on the maiſt gentile maner I could, I haue ſchawin ȝow, quhow ȝe haue far ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſene ȝour ſelf in this buik, of the quhilk, in my hart trewly I am ſorie. Praying ȝour L. heirfore, gif ȝe finde the Reaſonis I bring in aganis ȝours, to haue euacuat the reaſonis of ȝour buik in ony ſorte: vnderſtand my labours not to be, that I
<pb facs="tcp:177915:36"/> deſyre ȝour L. (quha excedis me far in vnderſtanding, and in all kynde of ſubtile reaſoning) to acknawledge ȝour ſelf to be ouercum be me, bot lat the veritie beare away the victorie for vs baith. And be ȝour acknawledgeing of thay things, ȝe haue ouerſene in ȝour buik, lat als mony people cum to the lycht of the Euangell, as ȝe haue haldin fra it, be the ſame, for God will require thare blude of ȝour handis, and ȝe perſeueir in ane wilfull obſtinacie, without knawledge. And gif ȝour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience dytis ȝow to fauld, and aggre to our ſentence, as ȝe promes in ȝour Bill, heirbefore writtin, gif ony part of ȝour Tractiue be confutit.</p>
               <p>Think nocht that ony man of Chriſtis Religione, luikis for the glorie of ȝour cumming, to the trew Religione teachit vs be Chriſte, as that ȝe come for wryting, or reaſoning of man: For we vnderſtand all, that thare can cum na man to Chriſte Ieſus, bot he quhom his Father drawis to him: quha is draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ȝow, and all men daylie. And tharefore, as ȝour freind, I wiſhe ȝow to ſubdew ȝour vnderſtanding, in the ſeruice of Chriſte, and of ȝour cumming, gif it pleaſe God, that ȝe cum to Chriſte Ieſus Religione, we ſall attribute na glore thareof to our ſelf, bot with ȝow of all our cumming and calling, we ſall giue God the glorie and thankis: quha oft tymes ſuffers ane Pharo or vther, to ring amangis his choſin people, be quhom he may baith declare his Name throuchout the earth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his people. And becauſe, he will haue mercy on quhom he will, and quhom he will, he will hardene. Roma. 9. of quhais will na man can giue ane reaſone. Tharefore tak head to ȝour ſelf, quhat ȝe write, that ȝe be not as ane Pharo halding the people in Egypt of Idolatrie and errour, fra the trew worſhipping of thare God, as he hes appointit in his Law: Bot cry for his mercy and grace (as I ſall do with ȝow) to illuminat ȝour hart with the trew knawledge of his worde, that ȝe may leaue ȝour Religion inuentit be man, and embrace that Religione, quhilk is ſet furth in the liuely worde of God: quhareby onely ȝe may cum to the Porte of Saluatione. And ſwa fair ȝe weill, as ȝe luife the Lorde Ieſus, and auancement of his Kingdome. At the Paedagoge of Glaſgw, the Firſte of Marche. 1562.</p>
